# Tracker Shoes! 

# ***Created by Kristian O'Brien***


Hi Everyone! I'm happy to share with everyone a new app that I built it’s called Tracker Shoes! I built this app because I love shoes, I would say I’m a collector, and opened shoes really introduced me to a lot of great places met some great people, here’s what this app does. This app allows you to store all the shoes that you have in your collection in one place, sometimes you may forget what shoes you have when thinking of an outfit to wear you can load up the app and see what you got, or maybe you sell and trade shoes as a hobby and need to list all the shoes you have for reference this is a great way to do that! This app is for any type of shoe lover!

# Things I would like to add to the game in the future 

- I would like to add a feature where you can invite other user to view your closet to see if they are interested in something that you have and make you an offer.
- I would also like to add another addition to my form so that the user can input if the shoe is brand new or not.
- I want to add a feature where users can leave comment on other people closet.
